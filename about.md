**Yonderesque** is the blog of a teenage girl from the UK, who works as a web developer part-time and has been making Tumblr themes since September 2012.
This site is used to explore my adventures in web development, be it at work or at home, and any projects that may arise from what I'm learning every day! I may not be an expert now, but improving is certainly a lot of fun. :smiley:

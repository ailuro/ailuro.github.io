Just a little update on my personal situation at the moment, because I feel it's at least slightly relevant...

Ever since the release of Everbloom I've been finding it very hard to find time to work on development at all outside of work. That is not to say I'm about to give up â€“ I love coding and being creative in this way, it's just that time has been really against me for a while.
For example, I've had some big exams. I still have big exams to go. In fact, almost all of my time problems are arising from school because I just have so much to do this year.

It's not all bad! I've found myself becoming more positive and more productive, which is great and I hope to keep it up. But as a consequence I fear that this means I won't be able to code in my spare time very much, because I'm not going to have a lot of spare time!!
I've got a few ideas in the making. I'm still trying to work out a problem which has been bugging me for months and am starting to consider asking one of my ~dev friends~ about it even though it might be awkward, haha. However, I think these things will be on hold for at least a little while. I just wanted to let you know!

Please bear with me, okay? It'll all be over eventually...

Hi everyone! Welcome to the brand new  (and more "professional") Yonderesque blog!

I've been using [Tumblr](http://yonderesque.tumblr.com) for while now, primarily because almost all of my coding projects so far have been Tumblr themes or something along those lines. So why the change?
Mostly, it's because I've wanted to move away from Tumblr as a whole for a while. I don't know how it'll go! It's a personal thing – I will still be making themes for Tumblr and the like!! Also: I'm sure at least a few people know that I already work part-time in web development, so I'd like to try using this blog to explore more complex stuff. Ideas! Dev stuff! Etc.

I've been thinking about getting a proper domain name for this... But I'm still not sure. Not yet, I think – we'll see!
